"""The override pack: fixes for non-standard devices published on this repository's `master` (`pack/`) and copied into a
host's `custom_converters/` directory, so a fix reaches users without a release. `OverrideWatcher` then loads the
copied files like the user's own.

`pack/manifest.json` lists the files with their SHA-256 (built by `scripts/build_pack.py`):

    {"version": 1, "files": [{"name": "00_pack_abc.json", "sha256": "...", "requires": 1, "until": 3}]}

`requires` / `until` (optional) bound the `LEVEL` of tuya2ildevice a file is for: a file that needs a newer
tuya2ildevice is not copied, and one whose fix is built into this tuya2ildevice (its `until` is at most `LEVEL`) is
removed. `LEVEL` goes up when a release adds something pack files may use, or takes pack files into `overrides.json`.

Ownership is explicit. `sync()` records what it wrote, by name and hash, in `.tuya2ildevice_pack.json` in the directory
(dot files are not loaded) and only ever writes or removes those files:

- a file of the user's with a pack file's name is left alone (the pack file is not copied);
- a pack file the user has edited since it was copied becomes the user's: it is no longer updated or removed;
- a file that fails to download or verify is skipped, and the copy already there stays.

The manifest is trusted as fetched over TLS; each file must match its hash. `.py` files are code converters and run in
the host's process, like the user's own: whoever can push to `master` can run code there. Everything here is blocking
(urllib): call it from a worker thread.
